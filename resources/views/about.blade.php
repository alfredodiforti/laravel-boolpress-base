    <h1>About US</h1>
    <p> 
     Would you say you’re an ‘animal lover’? It isn’t difficult to find people who say they love animals. 
     Many of us have cats or dogs, or both. In the United Kingdom, for example, almost half of households have pets.
     Very often these animals are thought of as family members. And a lot of us enjoy watching television programmes,
     like David Attenborough’s, that bring the wonders of the natural world into our homes. Yet most of those who call themselves ‘animal lovers’
     knowingly participate in animal cruelty – by eating meat, for example. Children easily appreciate the inconsistency here, but most adults still make excuses for their behaviour.
